Python Comments

In Python, comments are used to add explanatory notes or remarks within the code. Comments are ignored by the Python interpreter and do not affect the execution of the program. They are intended to provide clarity and make the code more understandable for other developers or for future reference.

There are two types of comments in Python:

Single-line comments: Single-line comments start with a hash symbol (#) and continue until the end of the line. They are used to add comments on the same line as the code.
Example:
"""

# This is a single-line comment
x = 10  # Assigning a value to the variable x


#############################################


"""
Multi-line comments: Multi-line comments are enclosed within triple quotes (''' ''') or double quotes (""" """). They are used to add comments that span multiple lines.
Example:
"""

"""
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span multiple lines without the need for the # symbol at the beginning of each line.
"""
y = 20  # Assigning a value to the variable y

"""


#############################################


Comments are useful in the following scenarios:

Documenting code: Comments can be used to explain the purpose, functionality, or usage of specific code sections, making it easier for others (including yourself) to understand the code later on.

Debugging: Comments can be used to temporarily disable or comment out a piece of code during debugging, without deleting it.

Reminders: Comments can serve as reminders or to-do notes for future code enhancements or fixes.

It is good practice to write clear and concise comments that provide meaningful information without being excessive or redundant. Well-commented code can greatly improve code maintainability and collaboration.

Remember, while comments are helpful, it is equally important to write clean and self-explanatory code that reduces the need for excessive comments. Code should be readable and understandable even without comments.

Example usage of comments
This is a single-line comment
"""
x = 10 # Assigning a value to the variable x

y = 20 # Assigning a value to the variable y

# Printing the values of x and y
print("Value of x:", x)
print("Value of y:", y)
